                        <p>Hello! I'm Warisha, a passionate web developer with a love for creating stunning,
                            user-friendly websites. I have a strong background in front-end and back-end development and
                            thrive on solving complex problems through code.</p>
                        <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new destinations, as traveling is my way of
                            gaining inspiration and experiencing different cultures. Each journey enriches my
                            perspective, which I bring back into my work, making my designs more diverse and globally
                            appealing.</p>
